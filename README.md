# Challenge-1

In this project we were given existing code and we needed to fix it by makeing it more user friendly. I ended adding alt elements to images, replacing div elements with other ones to make the code more readable. I grouped some lines of code on html to make the css code smaller and also reorganized the css according the structure of the page.
